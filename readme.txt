## About
FishVRâ€™s main objective is to combine artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR) to design an interactive and adaptive system for studying fish behavior. This behavioral research is an essential part of ecology, and fish health studies. Furthermore, it aims to address gaps of research in animal behavior studies, in particular research in fish behavioral response to visual stimuli. Most existing research is either inaccurate, basic, repetitive, and/or outdated. The key difference between this project and what currently exists is that FishVR seeks to automate the process of fish tracking.
